# Efficient Parking Website

The web service has been implemented to bring the Efficient service everywhere
Parking. The three basic points of the website are as follows:
 - Simple design: the site has been designed with a simple design that allows
to complete payment transactions quickly.
 - Security: the data stored in the database are not shared with
other companies. Passwords are not saved in clear text and are encrypted with a
latest generation one-way encryption method.
 - Organization: the site makes it possible to simplify the customer's life.

The website was written in HTML, a formatting language that describes
how to visualize the content graphically. HTML is not a language of
programming therefore, but only describes the layout methods. A
another language used is CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
cascade) used to define the formatting of HTML documents, which
allows you to customize tags as you like. Finally, for the programming part
Javascript, an object-oriented programming language, was used
and events that allow the developer to run scripts.
